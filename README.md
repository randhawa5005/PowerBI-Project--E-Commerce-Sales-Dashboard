# PowerBI Project - Ecommerce Sales Dashboard
Greetings, I am Muskanpreet, and I am delighted to present my Power BI project where I conducted an in-depth analysis of E-Commerce sales data and developed an interactive dashboard.

This project began with the meticulous cleaning and transformation of raw E-Commerce sales data using Power Query Editor, ensuring data quality and reliability for subsequent analysis.

The centerpiece of my project is the creation of a dynamic and insightful dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard features a variety of compelling visualizations including bar charts, line charts, donut charts, cards, and slicers. These visualizations were carefully selected and designed to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance, trends, and customer behavior.

I focused on enhancing user experience by incorporating interactive elements such as slicers for filtering and drill-through functionalities for detailed exploration of data points. 

This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing Power BI for advanced data analysis but also highlights my ability to effectively communicate complex insights through visual storytelling.

I invite you to explore this project to gain insights into leveraging Power BI for E-Commerce analytics and strategic decision-making.

Best Regards,

Muskanpreet
